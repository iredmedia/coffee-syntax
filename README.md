# Coffee-Syntax

A few quick examples of CoffeeScript! Lets take a look at:

- Variables
- Functions
- Loops
- Objects/Arrays
- Slicing
- Concatenation
- and more :)

## Build

1. First, take a look at:

   ``coffee/main.coffee``

1. Then run:

   `` bash ./build.sh ``
   
   
## Practical Use

Take a look at my [react-coffee-script](https://github.com/iredmedia/react-coffee-example) to get a clearer understanding of how to use coffeescript to reduce the amount of typing you do (which makes what I love doing - prototyping, much more enjoyable)
